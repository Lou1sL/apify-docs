**Learn how you can monetize your web scraping and automation projects by publishing and renting actors to users in Apify Store.**

---

When publishing your actor on the Apify platform you have the choice to make it a **Paid actor** and get paid by the users benefiting from your tool.

## Pricing models

All actors in [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) fall into one of these three pricing models:

1. **free** - you can run the actor freely and you only pay for platform usage the actor generates.
2. **paid** - same as free, but in order to be able to run the actor after the trial period, you need to rent the actor from the developer and pay a flat monthly fee on the top of the platform usage the actor generates.
3. **paid per result** - you do not pay for platform usage the actor generates and only pay for the results it produces.

## Where to start
