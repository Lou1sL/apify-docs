# Apify Platform

> **Apify** is your one-stop shop for web scraping, data extraction, and RPA. Automate anything you can do manually in a browser.
>
> **Actors** are serverless cloud programs running on the Apify platform that can perform arbitrary computing jobs such as send an email or crawl a website with millions of pages. They can be started manually, using our API or scheduler, and they can be easily integrated with other apps.
